Q and A Q - Is it possible to run c-lightning and lnd on the same host in parallel?
A - It absolutely is.</description></item><item><title>Rusty Russell - Getting Started With C-Lightning (2019-07-31)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/2019-07-31-rusty-russell-getting-started-with-c-lightning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/blockstream-webinars/2019-07-31-rusty-russell-getting-started-with-c-lightning/</guid><description>Rusty Russell

Introduction Hi everyone. We’re actually a couple of minutes early and I think we are going to give a couple of minutes past before we actually start because I think some people will probably be running late particularly with the change in times we had to make after this was announced. While we are waiting it would be interesting to find out a little bit about the attendees’ backgrounds and what they hope to get out of this.</description></item></channel></rss>
