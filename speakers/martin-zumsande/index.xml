In Adromain you also have this distinction between the new and the tried tables. So the new tables are for unverified addresses that someone just sent you and you don&amp;rsquo;t know whether they are good, whether there&amp;rsquo;s really a Bitcoin node behind them. And the tried table is addresses that you&amp;rsquo;ve been connected to in the past. So at some point, at least in the past, you know, they were your peers at some point.</description></item></channel></rss>
