If you don&amp;rsquo;t consensus on consensus, then some people are going to follow one chain and another another chain.
If you have unanimous consensus, then new upgrades work just fine. Developers write software, miners run the same stuff, and then there are no splits because PoW builds on other blocks and we&amp;rsquo;re all happy and the economy is all in agreement as well and everyone wins.</description></item><item><title>Playing With Fire Adjusting Bitcoin Block Subsidy</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/playing-with-fire-adjusting-bitcoin-block-subsidy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/playing-with-fire-adjusting-bitcoin-block-subsidy/</guid><description>Playing with fire: Adjusting bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s block subsidy Name: Anthony Towns (ajtowns)

Introduction First an apology about the title. I saw some comments on twitter after the talk was announced and they were speculating that I was going to break the 21 million coin limit. But that&amp;rsquo;s not the case. Rusty has a civil war thesis: the third era will start with the civil war, the mathematics of this situation seem einevitable.</description></item></channel></rss>
