Introductions Hi everybody. This is a talk on how much privacy is enough, evaluating trade-offs in privacy and scalability. This is going to be unusual for this conference because I will not be presenting new technical content. I am going to be talking about evaluating the tradeoffs between these scalability and privacy. As context, my name is Ian Miers.</description></item><item><title>Snarks And Their Practical Applications</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/simons-institute/snarks-and-their-practical-applications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/simons-institute/snarks-and-their-practical-applications/</guid><description>SNARKs and their practical applications Eran Tromer

Thank you very much. I would like to thank the organizers for giving this opportunity to learn so much from my peers and colleagues some of which are here. This is a wonderful survey of many of the works in this area. As I was sitting here, I was in real-time adjusting my slides to minimize the overlap.</description></item></channel></rss>
