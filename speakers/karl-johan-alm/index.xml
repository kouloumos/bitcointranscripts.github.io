Introduction Is there anyone here who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what bulletproofs are? I will not get to all of my slides today. I&amp;rsquo;ll take a top-down approach about bulletproofs. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about what they are, how they work, and then go into the rabbit hole and go from there. It will start dark and then get brighter as we go. As you leave here, you may not know what bulletproofs are.</description></item><item><title>Coin Selection</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/coin-selection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/tokyo-2018/edgedevplusplus/coin-selection/</guid><description>Coin selection https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1047708247333859328

Introduction I am going to do a short talk on coin selection. Everyone calls me kalle. In Japanese, my name is kalle. Coin selection, what it is, how it works, and interestingly enough- in the latest version of Bitcoin Core released yesterday, they have changed the coin selection algorithm for the first time since a long time. They are now using something with more scientific rigor behind it (branch-and-bound coin selection), which is good news.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Fee Estimation Via Mempool State</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/optimizing-fee-estimation-via-mempool-state/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/stanford-2017/optimizing-fee-estimation-via-mempool-state/</guid><description>Optimizing fee estimation via the mempool state Name: Karl-Johan Alm (DG Lab)
I am a Bitcoin Core developer and I work at DG Lab. Today I would like to talk about fees. There&amp;rsquo;s this weird gap between&amp;ndash; there are two things going on. People complain about high fees. But people are confused about why Bitcoin Core is giving high fees but if you set fees manually you can get a much lower fee and get a transaction mined pretty fast.</description></item></channel></rss>
