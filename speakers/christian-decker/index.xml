Intro Jeff Gallas: Next up is Christian Decker. He is a Lightning developer at Blockstream. He has got a very simple title. It is Security, Simplicity and DevOps: the trade-offs between a Lightning PPAS and running your own node. That is already half of the talk.
Christian Decker: Thank you very much, I’m Chris and for once I am not going to shill eltoo, I promise.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Network Panel</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/london-bitcoin-devs/2022-03-01-lightning-panel/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/london-bitcoin-devs/2022-03-01-lightning-panel/</guid><description>Topic: The Lightning Network in 2022

Introduction Hello everyone. I’m Christian. I’m a software developer at Blockstream and I work on Lightning, both the specification and the implementation. Today we are going to have a shortish webinar on how to get started with Lightning.
Q and A Q - Is it possible to run c-lightning and lnd on the same host in parallel?
A - It absolutely is.</description></item><item><title>Multiparty Channels (Lightning Network)</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-28-christian-decker-multiparty-channels/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-28-christian-decker-multiparty-channels/</guid><description>Multiparty Channels (Lightning Network) Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2019

Symmetric Update Protocols eltoo Update Mechanism Two days ago, we’ve seen the symmetric update mechanism called eltoo, and having a symmetric update mechanism has some really nice properties that enable some really cool stuff. Just to remind everybody, this is what eltoo looks like. That’s the one you&amp;rsquo;ve already seen. It’s not the only symmetric update mechanism, though.</description></item><item><title>Rendezvous Routing</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-28-christian-decker-rendezvous-routing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-28-christian-decker-rendezvous-routing/</guid><description>Rendezvous Routing (Lightning Network) Location: Chaincode Residency 2019

Introduction Okay, the second part is rendezvous routing. I basically already gave away the trick but I hope you all forgot. So what is rendezvous routing? Anybody have a good explanation of what we are trying to do here? So we have someplace where we meet in the middle, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have to know where you live, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to know where I live, we&amp;rsquo;re all really private.</description></item><item><title>Eltoo</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-eltoo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-eltoo/</guid><description>Eltoo: The (Far) Future of Lightning Location: Chaincode Labs

Intro Who has never heard about eltoo? It is my pet project and I am pretty proud of it. I will try to keep this short. I was told that you all have seen my presentation about the evolution of update protocols. I will probably go pretty quickly. I still want to give everybody the opportunity to ask questions if they have any.</description></item><item><title>Onion Routing Deep Dive</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-onion-routing-deep-dive/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2019-06-25-christian-decker-onion-routing-deep-dive/</guid><description>Onion Routing Deep Dive Location: Chaincode Residency – Summer 2019

Onion Routing Deep Dive But we&amp;rsquo;ve not seen exactly why we are using an onion, or why we chose this construction of an onion and how this construction of an onion actually looks like. So my goal right now is to basically walk you through the iterations that onion routing packets have done so far, and why we chose this construction we have here.</description></item><item><title>C-Lightning API</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-24-christian-decker-c-lightning-api/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-24-christian-decker-c-lightning-api/</guid><description>Developing on c-lightning Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2018

Intro Good morning from the last day of presentations. I’m Chris still. Today I will be talking to you about c-lightning, how to develop on it, how to extend it, adapt it to your needs and how to customize it so it fits into whatever you are trying to do. Not whatever we thought you might want to do.</description></item><item><title>History of the Lightning Network</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-history-of-lightning/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-history-of-lightning/</guid><description>History of the Lightning Network Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2018

Introduction Hi I&amp;rsquo;m Chris, as I said like three times before, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about the history of Lightning and history of off-chain protocols or layer two, or you name it, whatever name you want. I like to call them off chain because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t imply a hierarchy of layers but I&amp;rsquo;ll use all three terms interchangeably anyway.</description></item><item><title>Lightning ≈ Bitcoin</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-lightning-bitcoin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/chaincode-labs/chaincode-residency/2018-10-22-christian-decker-lightning-bitcoin/</guid><description>Lightning ≈ Bitcoin Location: Chaincode Labs Lightning Residency 2018
Video: https://youtu.be/8lMLo-7yF5k
Introduction Good morning everyone my name is Chris and I&amp;rsquo;m a bitcoiners anonymous. So my job today is basically to tell you why Lightning is Bitcoin and why it&amp;rsquo;s not exactly Bitcoin. So there&amp;rsquo;s a few fundamental differences between Bitcoin on-chain payments and Lightning. I will always call Bitcoin on-chain payments just because it&amp;rsquo;s sort of the classical way of doing it.</description></item></channel></rss>
