Let’s prepare mkdir workspace cd workspace git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git cd bitcoin git remote add kallewoof https://github.com/kallewoof/bitcoin.git git fetch kallewoof git checkout signet ./autogen.sh ./configure -C --disable-bench --disable-test --without-gui make -j5 When you try to run the configure part you are going to have some problems if you don’t have the dependencies. If you don’t have the dependencies Google your OS and “Bitcoin build”.</description></item><item><title>Signet Integration</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-06-kalle-alm-signet-integration/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/advancing-bitcoin/2020/2020-02-06-kalle-alm-signet-integration/</guid><description>Topic: Signet Integration

Intro I am going to talk about Signet. Do you guys know what Signet is? A few people know. I will explain it briefly. I have an elevator pitch, I have three actually depending on the height of the elevator.</description></item><item><title>Mempool Analysis &amp; Simulation</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/breaking-bitcoin/2019/2019-06-08-mempool-analysis-simulation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/breaking-bitcoin/2019/2019-06-08-mempool-analysis-simulation/</guid><description>Mempool analysis and simulation https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1137342023063744512

Introduction Fun fact: I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone knows this fact, but antpool is a miner and antpool is not mining replace-by-fee transactions. What I mean by that is that if you do a replace-by-fee transaction, they will ignore the second high fee transaction. There are cases where transactions are RBF-bumped to increase the fee to make it mined faster, so you RBF bump it, and then you have people spending the unconfirmed RBF version and then have a chain of transactions but then the original transaction is mined and not the other chained transactions.</description></item><item><title>Signmessage</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-10-10-signmessage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/bitcoin-core-dev-tech/2018-10-10-signmessage/</guid><description>https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/1049834659306061829
signmessage kallewoof and others
I am trying to make a new signmessage to do other things. Just use the signature system inside bitcoin to sign a message. Sign a message that someone wants. You can use proof-of-funds or whatever.
You could just have a signature and it&amp;rsquo;s a signature inside of a package and it&amp;rsquo;s small and easy. Another option is to have a .. that is invalid somehow. You do a transaction with some input, where the txid is the message hash or something.</description></item><item><title>Signet</title><link>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/signet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.kouloumos.com/bitcointranscripts.github.io/scalingbitcoin/tel-aviv-2019/edgedevplusplus/signet/</guid><description>Signet kallewoof

Introduction I was going to talk about signet yesterday but people had some delay downloading docker images. How many of you have signet right now? How many think you have signet right now? How many downloaded something yesterday? How many docker users? And how many people have compiled it themselves? Okay. I think we have like 10 people. The people that compiled it yourself, I think you&amp;rsquo;re going to be able to do this.</description></item></channel></rss>
