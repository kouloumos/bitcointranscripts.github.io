User activated soft forks vs hard forks Adam Levine (AL): I’m trying to look at the user activated soft fork thing and not see hypocrisy just steaming out of its ears. I’m really in need of you to help me understand why this is not the case Andreas.</description></item><item><title>Eric Lombrozo, Luke Dashjr - Taproot Activation (2020-08-03)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-magazine/2020-08-03-eric-lombrozo-luke-dashjr-taproot-activation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/bitcoin-magazine/2020-08-03-eric-lombrozo-luke-dashjr-taproot-activation/</guid><description>Name: Eric Lombrozo and Luke Dashjr

Introduction There&amp;rsquo;s not much new to talk about. Unclear about CODESEPARATOR. You want to make it a consensus rule that transactions can&amp;rsquo;t be larger than 100 kb. No reactions to that? Alright. Fine, we&amp;rsquo;re doing it. Let&amp;rsquo;s do it. Does everyone know what this proposal is?
Validation time for any block&amp;ndash; we were lazy about fixing this. Segwit was a first step to fixing this, by giving people a way to do this in a more efficient way.</description></item><item><title>John Light - Bitcoin Full Nodes (2018-07-23)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-07-23-john-light-bitcoin-full-nodes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/london-bitcoin-devs/2018-07-23-john-light-bitcoin-full-nodes/</guid><description>Name: John Light

Intro My presentation today is going to be about Bitcoin full nodes. Everything you wanted to know and more. There should perhaps be an asterisk because I’m not going to say literally everything but if anyone in the audience has any questions that want to go really deep down the rabbit hole then we’ll see just how far down we can go.</description></item><item><title>Luke Dashjr - Taproot Activation (2021-03-17)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-03-17-luke-dashjr-taproot-activation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2021-03-17-luke-dashjr-taproot-activation/</guid><description>Name: Luke Dashjr
