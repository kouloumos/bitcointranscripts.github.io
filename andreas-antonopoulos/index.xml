Are Hardware Wallets Secure Enough? Q - Hi Andreas. I store my crypto on a Ledger. Listening to Trace Mayer this week has me concerned that this is not safe enough. Trace says you need Bitcoin Core for network validation, Armory for managing the private keys and a Glacier protocol for standard operating procedures and a Purism laptop for hardware.</description></item><item><title>Andreas Antonopoulos - Initial Blockchain Download (2018-10-23)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2018-10-23-andreas-antonopoulos-initial-blockchain-download/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2018-10-23-andreas-antonopoulos-initial-blockchain-download/</guid><description>Andreas Antonopoulos

LTB Episode 378 - The Petro inside Venezuela &amp;amp; Schnorr Signatures
Schnorr signatures We’re currently using the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) which is a specific way of doing digital signatures with elliptic curves but not the only way. Schnorr signatures have some unique characteristics that make them better in many ways than the ECDSA algorithm we use today in Bitcoin.
Schnorr signatures are better because they have certain quirks in the way the mathematics plays out.</description></item><item><title>Andreas Antonopoulos - Seed Splitting (2020-04-08)</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2020-04-08-andreas-antonopoulos-seed-splitting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/andreas-antonopoulos/2020-04-08-andreas-antonopoulos-seed-splitting/</guid><description>Name: Andreas Antonopoulos
