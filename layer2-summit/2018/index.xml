Introduction First I am going to give a brief overview of how lightning works for those of who you may not be so familiar. Then I am going to discuss three technologies we&amp;rsquo;ll be working on in the next year at Lightning Labs and pushing forward.
Philosophical perspective and scalability Before I do that though, following up on what Neha was saying, I want to give a philosophical perspective on how I think about layer 2 as a scalability solution.</description></item><item><title>Scriptless Scripts</title><link>https://btctranscripts.com/layer2-summit/2018/scriptless-scripts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://btctranscripts.com/layer2-summit/2018/scriptless-scripts/</guid><description>Scriptless scripts

Introduction I am here to talk about scriptless scripts today. Scriptless scripts are related to mimblewimble, which is the other thing I was going to talk about. For time constraints, I will only talk about scriptles scripts. I&amp;rsquo;ll give a brief historical background, and then I will say what scriptless scripts are, what we can do with them, and give some examples.</description></item></channel></rss>
